# Portfolio Website Upgrade Plan

## Status: Complete ✅

I have successfully cross-checked and upgraded your portfolio website to a professional standard.

### 🎨 Visual & Design Upgrades
- **Premium Dark Theme**: Implemented a sophisticated dark mode with deep navy backgrounds (`#0f172a`) and vibrant sky-blue accents (`#38bdf8`), replacing the previous basic white theme.
- **Glassmorphism**: Added modern glass-effect cards for projects and forms using semi-transparent backgrounds and back-drop filters.
- **Typography**: Enforced `Poppins` font across the site for a clean, modern look.
- **Animations**: Integrated `AOS` (Animate On Scroll) for smooth entry animations and refined the typing effect in the hero section.

### 🛠 Technical & Code Quality
- **Semantic HTML5**: optimizing structure with `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` tags for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Structural Integrity**: Standardized the Projects Grid by wrapping all items (links and static cards) in a consistent `.project-card-wrapper` to ensure perfect alignment and behavior.
- **SEO Optimization**: Added proper `meta` descriptions and title tags to improve search engine visibility.
- **Responsive Design**: Fixed mobile navigation behavior (auto-close on click/outside click) and ensured grid layouts adapt perfectly to all screen sizes.
- **Robust Scripts**: Refined `scripts.js` to use `IntersectionObserver` for active tracking of navigation links and improved the email contact form handling with loading states.

### 📂 Files Modified
1.  **`index.html`**: Complete structural overhaul.
2.  **`styles.css`**: Complete rewrite for the new design system.
3.  **`scripts.js`**: Enhanced logic for animations and navigation.
